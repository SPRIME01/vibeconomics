## Project Overview

Vibeconomics is a comprehensive Agentic Application Framework built upon advanced architectural patterns. The project leverages Test-Driven Development (TDD), strict typing, and sophisticated backend architecture based on Hexagonal principles, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Aggregates, Unit of Work (UoW) pattern, Message Bus for domain events, and Dependency Injection (DI).

## Architecture and Design Principles

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, Aggregates, Value Objects, and Domain Events with no external dependencies
- **Service Layer**: Orchestrates use cases through Command Handlers, Query Handlers, and Event Handlers
- **Adapters Layer**: Infrastructure concerns including Repositories, Unit of Work implementation, and external service clients
- **Entrypoints Layer**: API routes (FastAPI) that primarily dispatch Commands or Queries

### Advanced Patterns Implemented

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Clear separation of write operations (Commands) from read operations (Queries)
- **DDD Aggregates**: Defined consistency boundaries within domain models
- **Unit of Work (UoW)**: Ensures atomicity for operations involving multiple Aggregates or Repositories
- **Message Bus**: Decouples components by publishing Domain Events when significant state changes occur
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: FastAPI's DI used to inject dependencies into handlers and entrypoints

## Core Components

### 1. LibreChat with DSPy Backend Integration

Provides OpenAI-compatible API endpoints with custom DSPy-powered language model backends.

### 2. DSPy and Outlines Integration

Core reasoning services that enable structured outputs and sophisticated AI reasoning patterns.

### 3. Mem0 Memory System Integration

Persistent memory storage and retrieval services for AI agents.

### 4. NLWeb and MCP Implementation

Natural language web interaction capabilities and Model Context Protocol implementation.

### 5. ActivePieces Integration

Workflow automation capabilities for AI-driven processes.

### 6. Additional AI Components

- [Google Application Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python.git)
- [CopilotKit](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit.git) Integration
- Advanced AI Workflow Orchestration

### 7. Storybook Component Documentation

Comprehensive component documentation and development environment for React UI components, featuring:

- Interactive component development and testing
- Automated documentation generation with accessibility testing
- Multiple environment support (local development and Docker integration)
- Visual regression testing capabilities

## Development Approach: Test-Driven Development & Strict Typing

This project strictly follows a Test-Driven Development workflow:

1. **Write Tests First**: Comprehensive tests using `pytest` that define expected behavior, interfaces, contracts, and emitted domain events
2. **Implement Minimal Code**: Simple production code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code structure and clarity while maintaining passing tests
4. **Document**: Add docstrings to all public interfaces

All Python code includes comprehensive type hints as per PEP 484, with successful mypy type checking.

## Getting Started

### How To Use It

You can **fork or clone** this repository and use it as is.

### Configure

Update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

### Generate Secret Keys

To generate secret keys, you can run:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

## Backend Development

Backend docs: [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md).

## Frontend Development

Frontend docs: [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md).

### Storybook Component Development

Storybook is integrated for component development and documentation:

```bash
# Start Storybook locally
cd frontend
npm run storybook

# Start Storybook with Docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.storybook.yml up storybook

# Build static Storybook for deployment
npm run build-storybook
```

Storybook provides:

- **Interactive Development**: Develop components in isolation with live reloading
- **Automated Documentation**: Auto-generated docs from JSDoc comments and TypeScript definitions
- **Accessibility Testing**: Built-in A11y addon for accessibility validation
- **Visual Testing**: Multiple viewport testing and visual regression capabilities
- **Component Controls**: Interactive controls for testing different component states

Access Storybook at `http://localhost:6006` during development.

For detailed Storybook usage and best practices, see [frontend/STORYBOOK.md](./frontend/STORYBOOK.md).
