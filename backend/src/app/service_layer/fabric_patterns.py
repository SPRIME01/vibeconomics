#             # Example: "query_for_remote_agent: This is a generated query for {input_text}"
#             # However, dspy.Predict processes this to extract the value for 'query_for_remote_agent'.

#             # The LM's direct output (the string) is what we're mocking here.
#             # dspy.Predict's signature "input_question -> query_for_remote_agent" means it expects the LM
#             # to produce text that, when parsed, yields a value for 'query_for_remote_agent'.
#             # A simple way is to have the LM return a string like "query_for_remote_agent: generated query"
#             # Or, if the LM is cooperative and the template is simple, just the value.

#             # Let's assume the LM is simple and returns the value directly,
#             # and dspy.Predict handles creating the structured output.
#             # The `Predict` module will wrap this.
#             # What dspy.Predict gets from the LM call is a list of completions.
#             # Each completion object (e.g., from OpenAI) has a structure.
#             # For `dspy.Predict`, the text itself should be the query.
#             # The `dspy.Predict` module itself adds the "query_for_remote_agent: " part to the prompt it sends to the LM
#             # and then it extracts the text that follows.
#             # So, the mock LM should just return the query text.
            
#             # If the prompt is "input_question -> query_for_remote_agent"

#             # dspy.Predict expects the LM to return a list of choices, where each choice is a dict.
#             # For non-chat models, it's usually {'text': 'output_value'}
#             # The dspy.Predict module will then extract "output_value"

#             # The `basic_request` is closer.
#             # Let's align with how dspy.Predict works: it expects the LM to output a string
#             # that it can parse using the signature.
#             # If the signature is "input -> output", and input is "question", output is "answer"

#             # Question: What is 1+1?
#             # Answer:
#             # LM should output: 2
#             # dspy.Predict will return a Prediction object like `Prediction(answer='2')`

#             # The mock LM should return the text that would be the value of query_for_remote_agent
